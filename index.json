Report The research provides a comprehensive view of the talent market that was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and its recovery since the lockdown restrictions were lifted. The report highlights the upswing in analytics jobs in the post-pandemic world and factors that have led to it.\nThis report also outlines which functional analytics skills and programming languages are currently most in-demand in the market. The report provides insights for recruiters and hiring companies to study the demand for skills across the analytics function. They can identify and close any capability gaps across workforces. By highlighting the talent hotspots in the country, the report enables organization\u0026rsquo;s to build a steady talent pipeline from various regions or cities.\n â€‹\tThis Job Study is a holistic analysis of the Indian Analytics and Data Science jobs and skills landscape. This study/report covers the top job trends in the analytics space, specifically open jobs at a given point in time. It provides a detailed break-up and analysis of jobs by certain criteria, such as cities, industries, experience levels, technologies/tools, and salary hierarchies. The report provides details and analysis of the types of companies that are recruiting key talent in the data science domain. The report identifies reasons for significant shifts or changes in hiring trends across the criteria defined above.\nTop Trends in Analytics and Data Science  Open Data Science Job Trends Analytics Jobs by Cities Analytics Jobs By Sector Or Industry (Excluding Analytics Jobs In The IT Sector) Experience Requirement For Analytics Jobs Analytics Jobs By Tools \u0026amp; Technologies Salaries Advertised For Analytics Jobs Analytics Jobs By Company Type  Conclusion There are approximately 138,000 jobs open in June 2021, a 67.0% increase from June 2020 when the average of advertised analytics jobs reached the lowest due to the pandemic.\nThis increase in job numbers can be mainly attributed to the backfilling activity of companies after they laid off many employees due to the lockdown in March 2020. It can also be attributed to the accelerated adoption of AI/data science in India, which is a direct result of the pandemic.\nRead the Report here\nPlease find reports from previous years here:\n 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017\n  Originally Published in AIM\n ","date":1623369600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623369600,"objectID":"03f6f17c01397c3e7d3de7bb72cec2ac","permalink":"/post/analytics-datascience-aims/","publishdate":"2021-06-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/analytics-datascience-aims/","section":"post","summary":"There are approximately 138,000 jobs open in June 2021, a 67.0% increase from June 2020 when the average of advertised analytics jobs reached the lowest due to the pandemic.","tags":["DataScience","AIMsReport"],"title":"Study: Analytics and Data Science Jobs in India: June 2021","type":"post"},{"authors":["PATOORI BHANU PRAKASH"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to import publication metadata into your reference management software.

You can focus on the content and Academic handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you\u0026rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.\nExamples Code Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head() ```  renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head()  Charts Academic supports the popular Plotly chart format.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026quot;chart\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\n  (function() { let a = setInterval( function() { if ( typeof window.Plotly === 'undefined' ) { return; } clearInterval( a ); Plotly.d3.json(\"./line-chart.json\", function(chart) { Plotly.plot('chart-594271638', chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true}); }); }, 500 ); })();  You might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with $...$ or $$...$$, respectively.\nExample math block:\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |} {\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$  renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left |\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right |^2}$$\nExample inline math $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$ renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the \\\\\\\\ math linebreak:\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$  renders as\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\n1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\nDiagrams Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams.
